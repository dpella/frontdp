## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly front-end interface for interacting with the WebDP API. This interface facilitates differential privacy tasks and analysis, allowing data curators to share datasets and assign analysts, and enabling data analysts to perform analytical queries while maintaining the privacy of individuals in the dataset.
